# Reggie-s-Linnear-Regression-Ballpit-Project
Off Platform Python Project for Codecademy's Python Fundamentals For Data Science (Part II) Path

Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Reggie is a mad scientist who has been hired by the local fast food joint to build their newest ball pit in the play area. As such, he is working on researching the bounciness of different balls so as to optimize the pit. He is running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls, and then fitting lines to the data points he records. He has heard of linear regression, but needs your help to implement a version of linear regression in Python.

Linear Regression is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of best fit.

In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.
